## La Comunita
La comunita is a REST service that creates a virtual environment for users so that they can interact with each other. Users have communities, groups and chats that can be joined by other users. Communities have groups, which should have at least 5 users to be active. Groups have chats, which deliver messages to all the members of the group.

## Tech Stack
We use Django with Django REST framekwork and PostgreSQL as a database. We use nose and unittests to write our tests.
